  The court **must** be able to reach you. So you have to give them some way to do this.
  
  Some forms allow you to tell the court you need to keep your address, phone,
  and email confidential, so that only court staff can see this information.

  It is important that the person or organization you deliver this form to
  is able to contact you. Make sure to include at least one way to reach you
